Analysis of Air Pollution Considering Weather Factors

# Air Pollution Analysis with Weather Factors

This project analyzes air pollution across different city districts, integrating air quality inspection data with weather conditions. The main goal is to identify temporal, spatial, and meteorological patterns in pollution levels.

## Description
The project combines air pollution exceedance data with weather parameters (wind speed, precipitation, temperature) and performs:
- Analysis of pollution exceedances by month.
- Assessment of pollution distribution across districts.
- Correlation analysis between weather and pollution.
- Geographic visualization via an interactive map.
- Creation of an interactive dashboard for detailed exploration.

Results are presented as plots, heatmaps, bar charts, and HTML files.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `folium`
- `plotly`
- `numpy`

Install them using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
